## 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements

### Service Integration
- **Alpaca Service**: All API calls protected by circuit breaker + retry logic
- **Gemini Service**: AI operations resilient to external API failures  
- **Routes Integration**: Monitoring endpoints added to main Express router
- **Frontend Navigation**: New monitoring section accessible from sidebar

### Error Handling Patterns
```typescript
// Circuit breaker + retry pattern
const result = await retryService.executeWithRetry(
  () => circuitBreaker.execute(apiCall),
  defaultRetryConfigs.externalAPI,
  'alpaca_placeOrder'
);
```

### Health Check Configuration
- **Alpaca**: 60s intervals, 30s timeout, 10% error rate threshold
- **Gemini**: 120s intervals, 45s timeout, 15% error rate threshold  
- **Database**: 30s intervals, 10s timeout, 5% error rate threshold

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

### TypeScript Compilation ✅
- **Status**: 100% clean compilation (0 errors)
- **Coverage**: All new services, components, and integrations
- **Types**: Proper interface definitions for all resilience patterns

### Code Quality
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with correlation IDs
- **Logging**: Structured logging for all resilience events
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and JSDoc for all public methods
- **Configuration**: Environment-based settings for all thresholds

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Zero Single Points of Failure
1. **External API Failures**: Circuit breakers isolate failing services
2. **Network Issues**: Retry logic with exponential backoff handles transient failures
